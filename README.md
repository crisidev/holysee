Thought out badly, understood worse and written the worst, this should be a telegram<->irc
relay bot with a reasonable configuration

**DISCLAIMER**: anything that can ever come from this package is pure garbage. Only a madman
would ever learn or study this package. You have been warned.

## Dependencies

This abomination uses the excellent [telegram-bot](https://github.com/telegram-rs/telegram-bot/) library by vendoring
a copy of it - to avoid depending on the latest git - in the `vendor/` directory. Many thanks to the original
authors for their excellent job.
